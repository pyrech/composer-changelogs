# Contributing

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Everybody should be able to help. Here's how you can do it:

1. [Fork it](https://github.com/pyrech/composer-changelogs/fork_select)
2. improve it
3. submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

Here's some tips to make you the best contributor ever:

* [Rules](#rules)
* [Green tests](#green-tests)
* [Standard code](#standard-code)
* [Keeping your fork up-to-date](#keeping-your-fork-up-to-date)

## Rules

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions
before maintainers accept and merge your work.

* You MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/) (see [Rules](#rules)).
* You MUST run the test suite (see [Green tests](#green-tests)).
* You MUST write (or update) unit tests.
* You SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request (see also how to [keep your
fork up-to-date](#keeping-your-fork-up-to-date)).

One may ask you to [squash your
commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want
commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description
which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.

Your work will then be reviewed as soon as possible (suggestions about some
changes, improvements or alternatives may be given).

## Green tests

Run the tests using the following script:

```shell
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
or the alias:
```shell
composer test
```

## Standard code

Use [PHP CS fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to make your code compliant with
composer-changelogs's coding standards:

```shell
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config=.php_cs --diff
```
or the alias:
```shell
composer fix-cs
```

## Keeping your fork up-to-date

To keep your fork up-to-date, you should track the upstream (original) one
using the following command:


```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pyrech/composer-changelogs.git
```

Then get the upstream changes:

```shell
git checkout master
git pull --rebase origin master
git pull --rebase upstream master
git checkout <your-branch>
git rebase master
```

Finally, publish your changes:

```shell
git push -f origin <your-branch>
```

Your pull request will be automatically updated.

Thank you!
